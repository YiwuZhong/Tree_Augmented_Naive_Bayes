The homework was done with Python3.6. 
However, the former versions of python should also be able to use.


The output shown by my code is the same as the benchmark.


The output is of the following form:
I wrote a script dt-learn.py for ease of implementation. 
To call my code, (in Windows) first cd the directory and then type in: python bayes.py lymph_train.arff lymph_test.arff n
In Mac or Linux, type in: ./bayes lymph_train.arff lymph_test.arff n

bayes is a bash file which will run "python bayes.py $1 $2 $3"
